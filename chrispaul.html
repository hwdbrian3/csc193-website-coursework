        <h2>Why I like the Player</h2>
        <li>Chris Paul is a "short" player in the NBA, but he is one of the most skilled and knowledgable. He has insane playmaking abilities and insane ball handling skills. His basketball IQ is one of the best. He is a selfless player that always make the right plays which in return help other players score.</li>
